            <h2>THE HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography">Photography</a>, as we know it, has come to be a form of art. This artwork can be done when the object being photographed is either 
                "in-motion" or "static". According to history, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce is the first man ever to take a photograph, better known as, "The Founder of Photography". Despite the fact that Joseph's works were lost in time,
                his title still remains strong. 
            </p>

                Looking deeper into history, historians made a discovery that in 1717, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Schulze">Johann Heinrich Schulze</a> used a light sensitive slurry to capture images of writings in a bottle.
                Despite that,he did not will to make his photographic results permanent. Instead, in 1800, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wedgwood_(photographer)">Thomas Wedgwood</a> made unsuccessful attempts in making photographic results permanent together with his associate, Humphry Davy.
                It was not until 1826 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic%C3%A9phore_Ni%C3%A9pce">Nicéphore Niépce</a> managed to fix an image captured with a camera after exposing the camera for several days or at least 8 hours.

                <br>
                Afterwards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre">Louis Daguerre</a> invented the daguerreotype process where a camera required few minutes of exposure in order to acquire plausible results.

            </p>
            <p>
                Fast-forward to the present, photography has become more of an art rather than just a discovery for the market worldwide. Now, photography has become more of talent enjoyed by many as much as people enjoy seeing the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh">Van Gogh</a>.
